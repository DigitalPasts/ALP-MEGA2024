# ALP-MEGA2024
The repository of the 2023/24 DANES-ALP working group. We focus on the theme of 'low-source' and 'under-studied' Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) languages, with a special emphasis on Elamite. The goal of the DANES-ALP 2023/24 working group is to discuss these challenges, and especially to try and resolve them in a supportive group setting.
