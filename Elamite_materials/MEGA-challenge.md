# 'Make Elam Great Again’ (MEGA) challenge for Ancient Language Processing 

## 2023/24 colloquium of the DANES Network

## Short Description
The 2023/24 DANES-ALP working group focuses on the theme of 'low-source' and 'under-studied' Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) languages, with a special emphasis on Elamite, although other similar languages are also a point of interest. 
Elamite, recorded from the 3rd to the 1st millennium BCE across diverse genres like royal inscriptions, documentary texts, and letters, is known in both linear-Elamite and cuneiform scripts. Despite its historical significance, Elamite remains largely under-researched, with many resources either unpublished or in need of comprehensive re-analysis. A deeper understanding of Elamite is crucial for insights into its various phases and its interaction with other languages like Akkadian during multilingual periods such as the Sukkalmah and Neo-Assyrian eras, influencing script, vocabulary, and possibly grammar.
Like many other ancient languages, Elamite lacks digital resources, tools, and corpora for computational study. As is customary in the historical and philological fields, researchers rely on analog resources, such as printed books and PDFs, that have been OCR’ed. Searching these resources and linking words, places, names, deities and other lemmas and ideas in the texts cannot be done in a systematic fashion.
The goal of the DANES-ALP 2023/24 working group is to discuss these challenges, and especially to try and resolve them in a supportive group setting. Moreover, we hope that these meetings could serve as a blueprint for the types of collaborative research that we would like to see happen in DANES, and eventually publish a joint paper on our results.
Another purpose of the working group, besides expanding digital resources for Elamite, is to teach the participants the different steps involved in digitizing traditional resources, from conceptualizing the goals and building ontologies, to practical implementation. The sprint style meetings will be cooperative hands-on sessions.
Participants will leave the workshop with confidence in conceptualizing and executing digitizing projects. We are hoping to see all sorts of interested parties, from students, through early career scholars, to professors
